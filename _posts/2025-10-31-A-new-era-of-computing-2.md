# A new era of computing - faster horses

In the advent of automobiles, a well-known saying from Henry Ford was, that if he listened to his customers, he would have built faster horses.

There is a parallel in probably every major technical invention, in that its use is first thought to be an extension, a forward-writing of existing technology. To me, it is close to evidence that our brain is working quite similar to LLMs actually. We also mostly imagine something we've already seen with maybe little variance - depending on our temperature. ðŸ˜Š 

And yet, new technologies and especially new use cases emerge and cannot be foreseen. In hindsight, everything can be explained with rational, but it is impossible to predict in advance.
